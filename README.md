express-publisher
=================

A raw express app that serves static content.
Can be used as a boilerplate to express apps, or to deliver content quickly & temporarly.

Usage
=====
    git clone https://github.com/cGuille/express-publisher.git
    cd express-publisher
    npm install
    sudo npm start

Then, you can browse to [http://localhost/](http://localhost/).

Note that npm start should require privilieges because it listens to the port 80.
If you want to start the server on another port, you may use the following command:

    node express-publisher.js [port]
    
Where [port] is the port you want to listen to.
